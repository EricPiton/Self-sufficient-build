Revision 1.48 by Eric Piton
Date: March 04, 2025
Description: A fully self-sufficient PC for office tasks and intensive gaming, generating power from CPU/GPU heat via ferrofluid, copper tubing, and TEG modules. Self-sufficient at idle, 50%, and 100% loads post-boot, with excess stored in a 200 Wh battery. Breaks even in ~2.84 years vs. traditional PCs. Built with real-world parts available today, maximizing ferrofluid shelf life (~5+ years).

Break-Even Analysis:
- Self-Sufficient:
  - Initial: $1,960
  - 3-Year Cost: $1,960
- Traditional:
  - Initial: $1,600
  - Electricity (197W, 6h/day): 1,294.29 kWh × $0.15 = $194.13
  - 3-Year Cost: $1,794.13
- Difference: $1,960 - $1,794.13 = $165.87
- Break-Even: ~2.84 years ($194.13 ÷ $360)

Notes:
- Self-Sufficiency: Achieved at all loads post-boot with excess power stored.
- Performance: 1440p ultra gaming (70–90 FPS), office multitasking.
- Battery: 200 Wh captures 100% load excess (~6.7h to full).
- Stability: Ferrofluid lasts 5+ years with 85°C cap, copper enhances durability.
- Build locked in with real-world parts as of March 04, 2025.
