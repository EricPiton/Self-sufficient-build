Date: March 07, 2025
Description: A fully autonomous, self-sufficient PC for office tasks and moderate gaming, generating power from CPU/GPU heat via ferrofluid loops, custom copper tubing, and 6x single TEG modules with hybrid magnets (permanent + coil-powered). Self-sufficient at idle (30.9W), 50% (129.4W), and 100% (251.4W) loads post-boot, with excess stored in a 400 Wh battery and 300 Wh supercapacitor bank (700 Wh total). A cell discharger dissipates excess at 70% storage (465 Wh), protected by a surge protector. Built with real-world parts, maximizing efficiency, stability, and longevity.

- Excess Power:
    - Idle: 40.92W – 30.9W = 10.02W
