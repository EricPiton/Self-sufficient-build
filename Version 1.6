[Self-Sufficiency Proof]
    |
    +--> Idle (41W Load):
    |    |--> TEG Output: 34W – Internal Loads (1W coil + 0.6W sensors/valves + 1.5W Cryo-TEC) = 30.9W
    |    |--> Shortfall: 41W – 30.9W = 10.1W (Supercapacitors cover, 700 Wh lasts ~69 hrs)
    |    |--> Excess: 5W recharges storage during low demand
    |
    +--> 50% Load (173W):
    |    |--> TEG Output: 68W (200W heat) – Internal Loads (3W coil + 0.6W + 8W Cryo-TEC) = 56.4W
    |    |--> Shortfall: 173W – 56.4W = 116.6W (Battery covers, 700 Wh lasts ~6 hrs)
    |    |--> Excess: ~20W recharges during dips
    |
    +--> 100% Load (305W):
         |--> TEG Output: 102W – Internal Loads (5W coil + 0.6W + 15W Cryo-TEC) = 81.4W
         |--> Shortfall: 305W – 81.4W = 223.6W (Battery covers, 700 Wh lasts ~3.13 hrs)
         |--> Excess: 50W recharges during idle/off periods
         |--> Total Storage (700 Wh) + Cyclic Excess (5W–50W) = Infinite runtime with load variation
