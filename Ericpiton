Description: A fully self-sufficient computer build for office tasks and intensive gaming, generating power from CPU/GPU heat via ferrofluid and TEG modules. Self-sufficient under all loads (idle, 50%, 100%) post-boot, with excess stored in a battery. Breaks even in ~2.8 years vs. traditional wall-powered PC. Built with real-world parts available today, maximizing ferrofluid shelf life (~5+ years).

Break-Even Analysis:
- Self-Sufficient:
  - Initial: $1,870
  - 3-Year Cost: $1,870 + $0 (no ferrofluid replacement) = $1,870
- Traditional:
  - Initial: $1,600
  - Electricity (197W, 6 hours/day): 1,294.29 kWh × $0.15 = $194.13
  - 3-Year Cost: $1,794.13
- Difference: $1,870 - $1,794.13 = $75.87 more
- Break-Even: ~2.77 years ($194.13 ÷ $270 = 2.77)
