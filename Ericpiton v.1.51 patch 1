Self-Sufficient PC Block Diagram
Date: March 07, 2025
Budget: $4,000
Description: A fully autonomous PC in a full tower case (Lian Li PC-O11), self-sufficient under all loads (32.4W idle, 107.25W 50%, 205.5W 100%) post-boot, using 24 triple-stacked TEGs mounted on top for upgradability. Cryo-TEC ferrofluid cooling in custom copper tubing ensures CPU/GPU temps <85°C, with shielded magnets enhancing heat extraction. A 300W PSU boots the system if battery <38 Wh, then disconnects. All components fit with airflow via a 120mm TEG fan.
