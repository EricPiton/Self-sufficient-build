@ericpiton91 version 1.50 patch 2
Date: March 05, 2025
Description: A fully autonomous, self-sufficient PC for office tasks and intensive gaming, generating power from CPU/GPU heat via ferrofluid loops, copper tubing, and 6x triple-stack TEG modules with a hybrid magnet (permanent + coil-powered). Self-sufficient at idle (41W), 50% (173W), and 100% (305W) loads post-boot, with excess stored in a 400 Wh battery and 300 Wh supercapacitor bank (700 Wh total). A standalone cell discharger with redundant controller dissipates excess at 70% storage (490 Wh), protected by a surge protector before the DC-DC Converter. Built with real-world parts, maximizing efficiency (~98.81% post-discharge), stability, and longevity (~20+ years).
